## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Game Details

The game is your standard memory game where you will select two cards in the matix of cards. If those two cards are a match, they stay 'flipped' over and will change color. once you have matched the whole matrix of cards to one another, the game will end and your score/rating will appear along with the oppertunity to try again.
